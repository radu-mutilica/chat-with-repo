    Example answer: 
    
    
    To become a miner, follow these steps:
    
    1. **Initialize the Core Miner**: You need to initialize the core miner by creating an 
    instance of the `CoreMiner` class from the `core_miner` module in the `run_miner.py` file: 
    
    ```python 
    miner = core_miner.CoreMiner()
    ```
    
    2. **Load Configurations and Resources**: Load all configurations and resources required for 
    mining by calling the following method:
    
    ```python
    bt.logging.info(\"Loading all config & resources....\")
    ```
    
    3. **Attach Capacities**: Attach capacities based on the loaded configurations and tasks. 
    This involves importing the capacity operation module, getting the operation name, 
    and attaching the capacity to the axon:
    
    ```python
    capacity_module = importlib.import_module(\"operations.capacity_operation\")
    capacity_operation_name = capacity_module.operation_name
    CapcityClass = getattr(capacity_module, capacity_operation_name)
    miner.attach_to_axon(CapcityClass.forward, CapcityClass.blacklist, CapcityClass.priority)
    ```
    
    4. **Run the Miner**: Finally, run the miner continuously with a sleep interval of 240 
    seconds in a while loop: 
    ```python 
    with miner as running_miner: 
        while True: 
            time.sleep(240) 
    ```
    By following these steps, you can become a miner in this subnetwork.
