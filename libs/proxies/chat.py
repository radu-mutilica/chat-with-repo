            *** File: *** mining/proxy/core_miner.py
            *** Code: ***
            ```python
            self.thread = threading.Thread(target=self.run, daemon=True)
                        self.thread.start()

                    if self.thread is None:
                        raise Exception("Oh no!")
            ```
            *** Summary: ***: The code snippet from 'mining/proxy/core_miner.py' initiates a background thread for the miner's operations, setting it as a daemon and starting it, while also updating the miner's running status. It also defines a method to safely stop the miner's background thread, ensuring it is not already None, and logs the stopping process.

            ```
            *** Summary: ***: The code snippet from 'core_miner.py' in the 'mining/proxy' directory of the 'vision' repository handles the validation of the miner's wallet. It checks if the wallet is registered with the Bittensor network, retrieves the unique identifier (UID) for the registered wallet, logs the miner's UID, and returns it for use in the mining process. If the wallet is not registered, it logs an error and instructs the user to register the wallet before proceeding.

            ```
            *** Summary: ***: The `main_run_loop` function in `core_miner.py` manages the mining operation loop. It initializes the last epoch block, logs the miner startup, and enters a loop that waits for the next epoch and resyncs the metagraph with the current block from the Bittensor network, ensuring the miner's data is up-to-date.

            *** Summary: ***: The code snippet dynamically attaches a mining operation to the miner's axon by obtaining the operation's class from a module and linking its 'forward', 'blacklist', and 'priority' methods for task processing within the 'vision' repository's decentralized AI inference network.

        Example Answer:
            
            Becoming a miner on Subnet 19 is an exciting venture! To get started, follow these steps:
            Step 1: Set up your environment
            Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Python and the required libraries. You can find the detailed setup instructions in our README.md file.
            Step 2: Register your wallet
            Create a wallet and register it with the Bittensor network. This will generate a unique identifier (UID) for your wallet, which is essential for mining. You can find more information on wallet registration in our documentation.
            Step 3: Configure your miner
            Modify the core_miner.py file to specify your wallet's hotkey and other necessary settings. This will allow your miner to connect to the Bittensor network and start processing tasks.
            Step 4: Start your miner
            Run the run_miner.py script to initiate your miner. This will start the background thread for your miner's operations, and you'll see log messages indicating that your miner is up and running.
            Step 5: Attach to an axon
            Use the run_miner.py script to attach your miner to an axon. This will enable your miner to receive tasks from the network and start processing them.
            Step 6: Monitor and optimize
            Keep an eye on your miner's performance and adjust settings as needed to optimize your mining experience.
            That's it! You're now a miner on Subnet 19, contributing to the decentralized AI inference network. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to our community for support."""
