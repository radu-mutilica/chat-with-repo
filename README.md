# Chat-With-Repo

## Overview

Chat-With-Repo is an advanced repository designed to facilitate seamless interaction with codebases through natural language queries. Leveraging the power of language models, this repository allows users to ask questions about the code, receive detailed explanations, and get step-by-step solutions to problems. The core functionality revolves around a FastAPI endpoint that processes user queries and provides context-aware responses.

## How to Run

You can run the Chat-With-Repo application using Docker Compose or deploy it on Render.com. Follow the instructions below.

### Running with Docker Compose

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-with-repo.git
    cd chat-with-repo
    ```

2. **Build and Run the Containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. **Access the Application:**
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Container Descriptions

### 1. **api**

- **Description:** This container hosts the FastAPI application that serves as the main interface for the Chat-With-Repo functionality. It processes incoming requests, interacts with the language model, and returns detailed responses.
- **Key Components:**
  - `api/app.py`: Contains the FastAPI application and endpoint definitions.
  - **Endpoint:** `/chat` - This endpoint accepts POST requests with user queries and returns context-aware responses.

### 2. **crawler**

- **Description:** This container is responsible for crawling and processing the target repositories. It clones the repositories, extracts relevant documents, and builds the context required for generating responses.
- **Key Components:**
  - `crawler/main.py`: Manages the crawling process, including repository cloning and README file extraction.
  - **Dependencies:** Listed in `crawler/requirements.txt`.

### 3. **libs**

- **Description:** This container includes various libraries and utilities used by the application. It contains the core logic for interacting with the language model and formatting responses.
- **Key Components:**
  - `libs/proxies/chat.py`: Defines the `ChatWithRepo` class, which generates detailed responses to user queries.
  - **Functionality:** Attaches methods (forward, blacklist, priority) from a capacity class to an Axon instance and runs the miner continuously.

## FastAPI Endpoint

To use the Chat-With-Repo functionality, you need to interact with the FastAPI endpoint provided by the `api` container.

### `/chat` Endpoint

- **Method:** POST
- **Description:** Accepts a JSON payload containing the user query and returns a detailed, context-aware response.
- **Request Payload:**
  ```json
  {
    "messages": [
      {
        "content": {
          "query": "Your query here",
          "repo": "subnet-19"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "response": "Detailed response from the language model"
  }
  ```

## Conclusion

Chat-With-Repo is a powerful tool for developers and users who need to interact with codebases in a natural and intuitive way. By following the instructions above, you can easily set up and run the application, enabling you to leverage its full potential. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to the community or consult the documentation.
